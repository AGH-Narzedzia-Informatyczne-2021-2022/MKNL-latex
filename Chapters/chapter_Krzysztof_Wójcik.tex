I added a photo of a \textit{Ambystoma mexicanum} (see Figure~\ref{fig:axolotl}).

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{This is a really mischievous axolotl.}

Table \ref{tab:table_KW} shows some data about certain functions.

\par
In mathematics, the \textbf{Taylor series} of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point. For most common functions, the function and the sum of its Taylor series are equal near this point. Taylor's series are named after \textit{Brook Taylor}, who introduced them in \underline{1715}.
\par
If 0 is the point where the derivatives are considered, a Taylor series is also called a \textbf{Maclaurin series}, after \textit{Colin Maclaurin}, who made extensive use of this special case of Taylor series in the 18th century.\\

Maclaurin series of the exponential function:

\[e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^4}{24} + \cdots\]
