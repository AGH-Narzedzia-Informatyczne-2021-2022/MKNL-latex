I added a picture of an otter (see Figure~\ref{fig:otter})

\begin{figure}[H]

Table~\ref{tab:random_modulo} represents some random numbers and their modulos.

\input{Tables/table1_Miłosz_Dubiel}

This is my favourite equation: \[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\]

And another one here:
$ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac $

This is numbered list:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Example 1
    \item Example 2
    \item Example 3
    
\end{enumerate}

And this is a list of items starting from dashes:

    \underline{Workstation to go.} \textit{Dell's Precision M3800} is an ultrabook-shaped mobile workstation, combining powerful components with a slim chassis. Our in-depth review will show whether this device is capable of delivering in all crucial fields, and not just in terms of looks. 
    \par
    Slim, good-looking ultrabooks have not only secured themselves a place on the wish list of private customers, but also on that of business users and professionals. Especially for representative purposes, these devices are much better suited than their rather chunky standard-issue business laptops. \textit{Lenovo's ThinkPad S440} and \textit{Dell's Latitude E7440} are typical examples of such business-orientated ultrabooks. Still, the \textit{Dell Precision M3800} takes this one step further, aiming at the market of powerful workstations. Luckily, no serious cuts seem to have been necessary, as the slim \textit{Precision M3800} comes with a quad-core CPU, \textcolor{green}{Nvidia's Quadro K1100M} GPU, a \textcolor{blue}{ high-resolution QHD+ display} and a decent selection of ports. Net pricing starts at 1400 Euros ($\sim$\$1912) and quickly reaches more than 2000 Euros ($\sim$\$2730).
